<b>Task Description:</b>This is an editable version of the Selective Interrogation Assessment Task developed by Reynolds et al. (2024). This task assesses selective interrogation of information, that is, 
the information an individual volitionally accesses from a pool of available information. The task permits computation indices representing the relative proportions of different categories 
of information selectively interrogated by each participant. For example, the relative proportions of negative and positive information accessed by the individual.
