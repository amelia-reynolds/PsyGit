<b>Task Description:</b> This is an editable Python code template for the Selective Interrogation Assessment Task developed by Reynolds et al. (2024). This task assesses selective interrogation of information, that is, the information an individual volitionally accesses from a pool of available information. The task permits computation indices representing the relative proportions of different categories of information selectively interrogated by each participant. For example, the relative proportions of negative and positive information accessed by the individual.
